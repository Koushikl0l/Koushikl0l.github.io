    <h1>ECG Anomaly Detection Using LSTM Autoencoders</h1>
    <p><strong>A Deep Learning Approach to Health Signal Reconstruction and Outlier Detection</strong></p>

    <p>Electrocardiography (ECG) is a vital, non-invasive diagnostic technique for assessing cardiac health. It captures the heart’s electrical activity and helps identify conditions such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarctions. However, with the proliferation of continuous monitoring through wearables, manual ECG analysis becomes laborious and prone to inconsistencies. To tackle this, deep learning methods—particularly LSTM-based autoencoders—offer an effective path to automate anomaly detection in ECG signals.</p>

    <p>This project explores an <strong>unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder</strong> trained solely on normal ECG signals. By learning the underlying patterns of healthy heart activity, the model becomes adept at reconstructing similar inputs. During testing, if an input deviates from the learned normal patterns—i.e., it's abnormal—the reconstruction error, measured by <strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</strong>, spikes. This serves as the signal for anomaly detection.</p>

    <p>The architecture includes an <strong>encoder</strong> that compresses the ECG sequence into a compact latent representation, and a <strong>decoder</strong> that reconstructs the original signal. If the reconstructed output closely resembles the input (i.e., low MSE), the sample is considered normal. Otherwise, it is flagged as an anomaly. A threshold of <strong>0.007</strong> on the MSE was selected based on validation performance, and any reconstruction loss exceeding this threshold was labeled abnormal.</p>

    <h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The LSTM Autoencoder achieved a detection accuracy of approximately 97% on the ECG5000 dataset. Using the 0.007 MSE threshold, the model correctly classified most abnormal signals with high sensitivity. ROC-AUC scores were reported above 0.95, showing strong separation between normal and abnormal signal reconstructions. The model also demonstrated good generalization on unseen abnormal patterns that were not part of the training distribution.</p>

    <h2>Why This Works</h2>
    <p>The autoencoder leverages the sequential nature of ECG signals using LSTM layers, which are designed to remember long-range dependencies. By focusing on healthy sequences during training, the model becomes specialized in reconstructing only those. When an unfamiliar signal (i.e., an anomaly) is passed, the reconstruction diverges significantly, exposing the anomaly through a measurable spike in MSE. This behavior is critical for health monitoring systems where anomalies are rare but impactful.</p>

    <h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
    <p>While effective, the current setup has notable limitations. First, it uses only one ECG lead, which may miss localized issues detectable in multi-lead setups. Second, the binary classification model does not differentiate between types of abnormalities. Future work could focus on:
      <ul>
        <li>Using multi-channel ECG data to increase diagnostic accuracy.</li>
        <li>Incorporating explainable AI (XAI) tools to visualize what the model focuses on.</li>
        <li>Applying dynamic thresholding using statistical techniques or learned calibration models.</li>
        <li>Integrating real-time deployment capabilities for wearable IoT devices.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Broader Impact</h2>
    <p>This approach has wide-ranging implications for scalable, low-cost health diagnostics. When deployed on edge devices like smartwatches or portable ECG monitors, it can facilitate early warning systems, especially in remote or underserved areas with limited access to cardiologists. Furthermore, this system can reduce the burden on healthcare systems by providing consistent, automated pre-diagnosis support, thereby enabling timely intervention and reducing morbidity and mortality due to cardiac conditions.</p>
