    <h1>ECG Anomaly Detection Using LSTM Autoencoders</h1>
    <p><strong>A Deep Learning Approach to Health Signal Reconstruction and Outlier Detection</strong></p>

    <p>Electrocardiography (ECG) is a vital, non-invasive diagnostic technique for assessing cardiac health. It captures the heart’s electrical activity and helps identify conditions such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarctions. However, with the proliferation of continuous monitoring through wearables, manual ECG analysis becomes laborious and prone to inconsistencies. To tackle this, deep learning methods—particularly LSTM-based autoencoders—offer an effective path to automate anomaly detection in ECG signals.</p>

    <p>This project explores an <strong>unsupervised LSTM Autoencoder</strong> trained solely on normal ECG signals. By learning the underlying patterns of healthy heart activity, the model becomes adept at reconstructing similar inputs. During testing, if an input deviates from the learned normal patterns—i.e., it's abnormal—the reconstruction error, measured by <strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</strong>, spikes. This serves as the signal for anomaly detection.</p>

    <p>The architecture includes an <strong>encoder</strong> that compresses the ECG sequence into a compact latent representation, and a <strong>decoder</strong> that reconstructs the original signal. If the reconstructed output closely resembles the input (i.e., low MSE), the sample is considered normal. Otherwise, it is flagged as an anomaly. A threshold of <strong>0.007</strong> on the MSE was selected based on validation performance, and any reconstruction loss exceeding this threshold was labeled abnormal.</p>

    <h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The model was evaluated using unseen abnormal ECG signals. In all test cases, it successfully identified anomalies by comparing the MSE against the pre-defined threshold. The reconstruction plots clearly demonstrated how abnormal signals led to greater reconstruction errors, supporting the efficacy of the approach.</p>

    <h2>Why This Works</h2>
    <p>The LSTM Autoencoder excels at learning and reconstructing sequential patterns. Trained only on normal ECGs, it cannot generalize to abnormal patterns, leading to high reconstruction loss when anomalies occur. This characteristic makes it an ideal candidate for scenarios where abnormal data is rare or unlabeled.</p>

    <h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
    <p>Despite promising results, the approach has limitations: it uses only a single ECG lead, performs binary classification, and depends on a static threshold. Future work could address these by incorporating multi-lead ECGs, dynamic thresholding, attention mechanisms, and interpretability tools like saliency maps to explain the model's decisions.</p>

    <h2>Broader Impact</h2>
    <p>This model has potential applications in real-time, on-device cardiac monitoring via health wearables. Early anomaly detection could prompt timely medical intervention, reducing hospital admissions and improving patient outcomes. It represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-powered preventive healthcare.</p>
