    <h1>ECG Anomaly Detection Using LSTM Autoencoders</h1>
    <p><strong>A Deep Learning Approach to Health Signal Reconstruction and Outlier Detection</strong></p>

    <p>Electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most common and vital non-invasive methods to evaluate the heart’s condition. It provides insight into the electrical activity of the heart over time and is frequently used to detect arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, and other cardiovascular abnormalities. However, manual inspection of ECG signals is labor-intensive and prone to subjectivity, particularly when dealing with massive volumes of data from wearable sensors or hospital monitors. To address this, machine learning—particularly deep learning—offers a promising way to automate the identification of abnormalities and support early diagnosis.</p>

    <p>In this project, I explored an <strong>unsupervised deep learning</strong> technique to detect anomalies in ECG signals using a <strong>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder</strong>. The autoencoder model was trained exclusively on normal ECG data, meaning it learned to recognize the natural waveform patterns associated with healthy heart activity. It was not shown any abnormal signals during training. Once trained, the model attempted to reconstruct incoming ECG sequences. If the reconstruction was close to the original input, the signal was likely normal. Conversely, a poor reconstruction indicated that the signal diverged from what the model had learned, marking it as potentially abnormal.</p>

    <p>The core architecture involves an encoder-decoder setup. The <strong>encoder</strong> compresses the input ECG sequence into a lower-dimensional latent representation, capturing its temporal features. The <strong>decoder</strong> then attempts to reconstruct the original signal from this compressed form. Since the model was trained solely on clean data, it performs well when fed normal ECGs. However, when an unseen abnormal signal is introduced, the reconstruction deviates significantly, producing a higher <strong>reconstruction loss</strong>, which we measured using <strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</strong>. This loss becomes the central metric for anomaly detection.</p>

    <p>To distinguish between normal and abnormal signals during inference, we needed to define a decision boundary. We analyzed the MSE distribution of reconstruction errors on normal validation data and set a threshold empirically. In this experiment, we selected <strong>0.007</strong> as the optimal threshold. Any input ECG sample that produced a reconstruction loss higher than this value was labeled as an anomaly.</p>

    <h2>Performance Evaluation</h2>
    <p>To evaluate our model’s effectiveness, we tested it with several unseen ECG signals labeled as abnormal and plotted the reconstructed waveforms alongside their loss values. In all three test cases, the model correctly detected the anomalies based on the reconstruction loss surpassing the 0.007 boundary.</p>

    <h2>Why This Works</h2>
    <p>This method is effective because the LSTM Autoencoder learns only the "normal" patterns of ECGs. When abnormal signals are passed through the model, it cannot accurately reconstruct the unfamiliar patterns, resulting in a noticeable spike in reconstruction error. This approach is particularly useful in real-world settings where labeled abnormal data is scarce or difficult to obtain.</p>

    <h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
    <p>While promising, this approach comes with limitations: it uses a single ECG lead; it performs binary classification without labeling the type of anomaly; and it uses a static threshold that could be made dynamic. Future work can include using multi-lead ECGs, adding attention mechanisms, and introducing explainability tools such as saliency maps.</p>

    <h2>Broader Impact</h2>
    <p>This project is a foundational step toward real-time, intelligent health monitoring. By deploying this model on edge devices or integrating it into health wearables, we can continuously monitor patient ECGs and detect early signs of cardiac issues before clinical symptoms manifest. This not only enables preventative healthcare but also reduces the burden on hospitals and caregivers.</p>
