        <p>
            Misdiagnosis and medical negligence are persistent and serious challenges in Bangladesh’s healthcare system.
            A mixed-methods survey of students and healthcare users recently revealed that <strong>43.5%</strong> of respondents had personally experienced misdiagnosis, 
            with <strong>72.7%</strong> believing AI could significantly reduce these errors 
            (<a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com">qualitysafety.bmj.com</a>, <a href="https://researchgate.net">researchgate.net</a>, <a href="https://unb.com.bd">unb.com.bd</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Investigative journalism highlights the tragic consequences of diagnostic lapses—most notably in stroke care—
            where a four-day delay in treatment frequently leads to irreversible brain damage, long-term disability, or death 
            (<a href="https://unb.com.bd">unb.com.bd</a>). A 2013 compilation reported 27 deaths and 2 cases of permanent disability in just 29 instances of wrong treatment or negligence,
            often triggering social unrest directed at healthcare workers 
            (<a href="https://ubinig.org">ubinig.org</a>, <a href="https://unb.com.bd">unb.com.bd</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            These events occur within a broader institutional context marked by limited infrastructure, workforce shortages, and inadequate patient disclosure norms under the current ethical framework 
            (<a href="https://researchgate.net">researchgate.net</a>, <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com">bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com</a>, <a href="https://journals.library.columbia.edu">journals.library.columbia.edu</a>).
            The implications extend beyond clinical outcomes: misdiagnoses damage public trust, trigger financial stress, and exacerbate stigma—particularly in mental health, 
            where incorrect treatments for conditions like depression may worsen patient safety 
            (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Against this backdrop, our proposed multimodal AI diagnostic framework offers a powerful tool to address both the scale and gravity of diagnostic errors.
            By integrating imaging, EHR data, genomics, lab results, and audio signals, the system aims to mimic clinicians’ holistic reasoning with enhanced precision. 
            Leveraging explainable AI and clinician feedback, our approach not only targets improved accuracy—potentially reducing diagnostic delays like those observed in stroke cases—
            but also seeks to rebuild public confidence and improve ethical standards in care delivery.

        <h4><b>Abstract:</b></h4>
        <p>
            This paper proposes a novel multimodal AI-based diagnostic system that integrates diverse healthcare data types—medical imaging, clinical text, genomic information,
            audio samples, and structured vitals—to outperform traditional diagnostic pipelines. By fusing heterogeneous data sources via modality-specific encoders and an attention-based
            fusion module, the proposed system achieves improved diagnostic accuracy and robustness. We introduce a training architecture supported by mathematical formulations and reference
            state-of-the-art techniques in multimodal learning and healthcare AI. This approach aims not only to improve individual diagnostic outcomes but also to serve as a foundational 
            infrastructure for AI-powered hospital systems.</p>
        
        <h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>
        <p>  
            Medical diagnostics is an inherently complex process involving various data sources and interpretations. Despite advancements in computer-aided diagnostics (CAD), current tools often 
            rely on unimodal inputs such as radiology images or tabular electronic health records (EHRs). This limitation creates diagnostic blind spots. Motivated by recent breakthroughs in multimodal AI,
             we propose a pipeline that integrates five complementary data types to enhance disease detection performance. Our work envisions a holistic AI framework that combines structured and unstructured
              data in real time, mimicking the reasoning style of experienced clinicians while offering scale, consistency, and speed.</p>
        
        <h3><b>Related Work:</b></h3>
        <p>
            Previous work such as ClinicalBERT [Alsentzer et al., 2019] and HEALNet [Nguyen et al., 2021] laid the foundation for healthcare-specific natural language and multimodal processing. 
            Similarly, Pathomic Fusion and multimodal transformers [Tsai et al., 2019] inspired our attention-based architecture. Genomic modeling using DNABERT [Ji et al., 2021] and acoustic health 
            diagnostics [Orlandic et al., 2021] further expand the scope of AI in patient evaluation. We extend these models by incorporating genomics and audio modalities and focusing on real-time, 
            adaptive learning through clinician feedback, while integrating domain knowledge and ethical oversight into system design.
