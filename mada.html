            Misdiagnosis and medical negligence are persistent and serious challenges in Bangladesh’s healthcare system.
            A mixed-methods survey of students and healthcare users recently revealed that <strong>43.5%</strong> of respondents had personally experienced misdiagnosis, 
            with <strong>72.7%</strong> believing AI could significantly reduce these errors 
            (<a href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com">qualitysafety.bmj.com</a>, <a href="https://researchgate.net">researchgate.net</a>, <a href="https://unb.com.bd">unb.com.bd</a>).

            Investigative journalism highlights the tragic consequences of diagnostic lapses—most notably in stroke care—
            where a four-day delay in treatment frequently leads to irreversible brain damage, long-term disability, or death 
            (<a href="https://unb.com.bd">unb.com.bd</a>). A 2013 compilation reported 27 deaths and 2 cases of permanent disability in just 29 instances of wrong treatment or negligence,
            often triggering social unrest directed at healthcare workers 
            (<a href="https://ubinig.org">ubinig.org</a>, <a href="https://unb.com.bd">unb.com.bd</a>).

        <p>
            These events occur within a broader institutional context marked by limited infrastructure, workforce shortages, and inadequate patient disclosure norms under the current ethical framework 
            (<a href="https://researchgate.net">researchgate.net</a>, <a href="https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com">bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com</a>, <a href="https://journals.library.columbia.edu">journals.library.columbia.edu</a>).
            The implications extend beyond clinical outcomes: misdiagnoses damage public trust, trigger financial stress, and exacerbate stigma—particularly in mental health, 
            where incorrect treatments for conditions like depression may worsen patient safety 
            (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>).

        <p>
            Against this backdrop, our proposed multimodal AI diagnostic framework offers a powerful tool to address both the scale and gravity of diagnostic errors.
            By integrating imaging, EHR data, genomics, lab results, and audio signals, the system aims to mimic clinicians’ holistic reasoning with enhanced precision. 
            Leveraging explainable AI and clinician feedback, our approach not only targets improved accuracy—potentially reducing diagnostic delays like those observed in stroke cases—
            but also seeks to rebuild public confidence and improve ethical standards in care delivery.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the following methodology, we mathematically formalize this system and benchmark it against current single-modality approaches, 
            demonstrating its potential to transform Bangladesh’s healthcare diagnostic landscape.
